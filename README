=== HOW TO RUN ===
1) Select node configuration

  make CONFIG=static
    (for nodes with static ids in the key space -- easy debugging)

  or

  make CONFIG=dynamic
    (nodes with random ids in the key space -- best load balancing)

  This will symlink config.json to a config file to use.

2) Start directory server
  ./directory_server.py [port]
  ./directory_server.py 1234

  Note: node config files reference this port, so if you change it
  make sure to update config-*.json as well.

3) Start node(s)
  To start a node run
    ./app.py n

  where n is a node id defined in config.json


=== SUGGESTED STARTUP SEQUENCE ===
1) make CONFIG=2ring-dynamic
2) Console 0: ./directory_server.py 1234
3) Console 1: ./app.py 0
4) Console 2: ./app.py 1
5) Console 3: ./app.py 3
6) Console 4: ./app.py 4

7) Console 1: help
   This will give a listing of commands


=== THINGS TO TRY ===
Leading number corresponds to node number:

0: friend 101
0: friend 102
0: defriend 101
4: friend_list 100
  node 0 has user_id 100
  note: node 4 is in a different ring but still sees the data!
  note: keys with null data are irrelevant
3: friend_list 100
0: wall_post 100 101 is not my friend
1: wall_read 100
  node 1 has user_id 101
  notice that received data has a requires tag corresponding to user 100's friends list
  with 101 removed!
1: get 0_100_friends
1: friend_list 100

Examine data for a few nodes (e.g. 3, 4):
3: data
4: data

Terminate 3:
3: exit (or Ctrl+C, or Ctrl+D)
4: data
  data from node 3 has been transferred to node 4
