=== HOW TO RUN ===
Run either
  make CONFIG=static
    (for nodes with static ids in the key space -- easy debugging)
or
  make CONFIG=dynamic
    (nodes with random ids in the key space -- best load balancing)

This will symlink config.json to a config file to use.


To start a node run
  ./app.py n

where n is a node id defined in config.json
