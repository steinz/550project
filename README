=== HOW TO RUN ===
1) Select node configuration

  make CONFIG=static
    (for nodes with static ids in the key space -- easy debugging)

  or

  make CONFIG=dynamic
    (nodes with random ids in the key space -- best load balancing)

  This will symlink config.json to a config file to use.


2) Start directory server

  ./directory_server.py [port]
  ./directory_server.py 1234

  Note: node config files reference this port, so if you change it
  make sure to update config-*.json as well.


3) Start node(s)
  To start a node run
    ./app.py n

  where n is a node id defined in config.json
